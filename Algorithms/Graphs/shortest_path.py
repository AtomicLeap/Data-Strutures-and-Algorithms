# shortest path

"""
Write a function, shortestPath, that takes in an array of edges for an undirected 
graph and two nodes (nodeA, nodeB). The function should return the length of the 
shortest path between A and B. Consider the length as the number of edges in the 
path, not the number of nodes. If there is no path between A and B, then return -1. 
You can assume that A and B exist as nodes in the graph.

# NOTE: For undirected graphs, You will always need a visited list/set/dict to 
# keep tract of visited nodes. This is to avoid being trapped in infinite loop.

# The Breath First Approach is best suited for finding Shortest Path between Nodes. 
# Unlike Depth First Approach. BF optimizes the search already!
