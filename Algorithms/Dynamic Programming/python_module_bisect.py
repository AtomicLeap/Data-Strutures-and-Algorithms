# Bisect

# What is bisect in Python?
"""
bisect is a built-in Python module that helps you:

1. Maintain a sorted list efficiently.

2. Find insertion points for new elements (using binary search).

3. Insert elements into a sorted list at the correct position.

It avoids you having to sort every time you insert something — instead, you can binary search the correct position in O(log n) time.
"""

# Importing
"""
import bisect

Now you can use:

bisect_left()

bisect_right()

insort_left()

insort_right()
"""

# bisect_left(list, num)

"""
Finds the insertion index to insert x into list while keeping it sorted —
it returns the first index where x can go without breaking order.

If x already exists in the list, it returns the leftmost index.
"""
from bisect import bisect_left

arr = [1, 3, 4, 4, 5]
i = bisect_left(arr, 4)
print(i)  # Output: 2

"""
Explanation:

Indexes:   0  1  2  3  4
Values:   [1, 3, 4, 4, 5]
                 ^
                 └── first position where 4 could go


So inserting at index 2 keeps the list sorted.
"""

# bisect_right(list, num) (aka bisect())

"""
Similar, but it returns the index after the rightmost occurrence of x.
"""
from bisect import bisect_right

arr = [1, 3, 4, 4, 5]
i = bisect_right(arr, 4)
print(i)  # Output: 4

"""
Explanation:

Indexes:   0  1  2  3  4
Values:   [1, 3, 4, 4, 5]
                       ^
                       └── after last 4

So inserting at index 4 would place the new 4 after existing ones.

# Common Uses of bisect
"""
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Use Case	                        |          Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Maintaining sorted lists	                |   Efficiently insert while keeping order.
2. Binary search utilities	                |   Quickly find lower/upper bounds.
3. Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)	    |   To replace the first element ≥ x (via bisect_left).
4. Range counting	                        |   To find how many numbers fall in [low, high) using two bisect calls.
5. Leaderboard or ranking systems	        |   To insert new scores in sorted order efficiently.
"""

# Example – Range Counting

"""
Suppose we have a sorted list of scores:
"""

scores = [20, 35, 40, 50, 60, 75, 90]

"""
Find how many scores are between 40 and 70:
"""

from bisect import bisect_left, bisect_right

low = bisect_left(scores, 40)   # first index ≥ 40 → 2
high = bisect_right(scores, 70) # first index > 70 → 5

count = high - low
print(count)  # Output: 3  (40, 50, 60)

# Example – Longest Increasing Subsequence LIS

"""
We use bisect_left because:

We want to replace the first element ≥ x (to keep subsequence strictly increasing).

It gives the smallest possible tail for subsequences of that length.
"""

from bisect import bisect_left

nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
tails = []

for num in nums:
    i = bisect_left(tails, num)
    if i == len(tails):
        tails.append(num)
    else:
        tails[i] = num
print(tails)  # [2, 3, 7, 18]

"""
Use bisect_left when you need strictly increasing sequences or lower bounds.

Use bisect_right when you want non-decreasing or upper bounds.
